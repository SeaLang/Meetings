Hello All, thanks for coming to my talk on VHDL
(Or at least spending time reading over this)

First of all, here is the VHDL prezi that I have made

Altera FPGAs uses Quartus as an IDE - Web Version should be enough for normal needs

A good board to start off with would be

This is the project that I made

Unfortunately, VHDL isn't like Java where there's a nice central learning source (Oracle)
A book that I'd recommend is Digital Design with RTL Design, VHDL and Verilog by Frank Vahid
Amazon Link:http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-RTL-VHDL-Verilog/dp/0470531088
(If you don't feel like paying at least you know the book name now)

Anyways, If you'd like to get in touch with me:
